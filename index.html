			<p>It’s no secret that most major industries have experienced a supply-chain disruption over the last year and a half. But while consumers have grown accustomed to certain items being scarcer than usual, it appears another industry has fallen victim to nationwide and global shortages: the publishing industry.</p>

			<p> As demand increases and supply is harder and more expensive to produce and distribute, the U.S. is on track to experience an unprecedented shortage in physical books. Devon Dunn, senior manager and principal buyer at Book Culture, said that they’ve never seen a shortage like this in their eight years of working for the popular New York City bookstore chain.</p>

			<p>“Books that used to take three days for us to get are now taking a week,” Dunn shared in the back office of Book Culture’s flagship store on 112th street. “That doesn’t sound big, but that’s you know, it’s all a ripple effect.”</p>


			<p>With the holiday season on its way, publishers warn that popular titles will be harder to grab. That leaves booksellers and bookworms wondering: how exactly did we get here?</p>

					<p class="description"> Widespread lockdowns meant that people were devoting more time to at-home entertainment, like reading. Even as the economy reopens and vaccines have made in-person entertainment safer, it doesn’t look like we’re kicking our book habit any time soon. NPD Bookscan, a major industry data tracker, says the US publishing industry has seen a 13.2% rise in printed book sales in 2021. That increase is usually between 3 and 4% year over year.</p>

		<div class="Reasons">
			<p class="heading">Publishing Costs</p>
				<img class ="Icons" src="Images/Paper.png" alt="Paper">
				<p class="description">Publishing physical books has become more expensive over the last year. In 2021, the price of wood pulp rose from $700-750 metric ton to almost $1200 per metric ton. This pricing increase is the result of a number of factors, including environmental initiatives to use paper products instead of plastic, and an increased need for cardboard shipping products to keep up with the recent e-commerce boom. Coupled with an ink shortage and the disinvestment in publishing physical books in favor of e-readers, American book manufacturers are left to grapple with an unprecedented cost of production. </p>

		<div class="Reasons">
			<p class="heading">The Labor Shortage</p>
			<img class="Icons" src="Images/Truck.png" alt="Truck">
			<p class="description">A shortage of truck drivers means that the transportation of manufactured goods, including books, is taking longer than usual. This creates a domino effect with far-reaching consequences. There’s no one to drive products to retailers and consumers, which then leaves said products sitting in warehouses and shipping ports for weeks, even months. In turn, shipping costs  increase, making it more difficult and more expensive for smaller retailers, like independent bookstores, to have inventory shipped to them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="Reasons">
			<p class="heading">Amazon's Reign</p>
			<img class="Icons" src="Images/PrintingPress.png" alt="Printing Press">
			<p class="description">Small printing presses are feeling the pressure from one of the biggest book retailers in the world: Amazon. By 2020, after all three major U.S. printing presses ceased operations, smaller presses were left to print most of the U.S.'s books. As Amazon  negotiates with publishers for the pricing possible, these smaller presses are facing major profit losses that they'd normally compensate for by cutting wages. But Amazon is able to pay workers a minimum of $15 an hour, and smaller presses are unable to compete for the labor they need. </p>
